This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(igraph)
library(ggraph)
library(tidygraph)
```

```{r}
parent_dir <- dirname(getwd())
file_path <- file.path(parent_dir, "raw_downloads", "SDC_data_2021.rds")

sdc <- readRDS(file_path) %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    participants = participants %>%
      trimws() %>% na_if("") %>% na_if("NA") %>% na_if("<NA>")
  )
```

```{r}
dir(dirname(getwd())S)
```
